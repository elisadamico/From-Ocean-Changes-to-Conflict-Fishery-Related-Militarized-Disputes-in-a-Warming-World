# From-Ocean-Changes-to-Conflict-Fishery-Related-Militarized-Disputes-in-a-Warming-World
This project provides data, data replication code, and methodological and visualization replication code for the Fishery-related MIDs project. 


Abstract: As climate change reshapes the worldâ€™s oceans, the battle for dwindling fish stocks intensifies, leading to an alarming rise in fishery-related militarized dis- putes (MIDs). Fishery-related militarized disputes (MIDs) represent a significant and growing area of geopolitical tension, exacerbated by shifting fish distribu- tions due to climate change. This project analyzes data on fishery-related MIDs. By integrating historical patterns with climate change projections, we identify how alterations in climatological factors and fish distributions influence the fre- quency of MIDs. Our findings highlight regions and conditions most susceptible to future disputes, providing valuable insights for policymakers and international bodies to preempt and mitigate conflict. This research underscores the necessity for adaptive fisheries management and international cooperation to address the dual challenges of environmental change and geopolitical stability.
